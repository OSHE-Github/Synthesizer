**Tips for uploading and running firmware on the Teensy**

- You will need the Arduino IDE to upload the firmware to the Teensy. Instructions: [Arduino IDE install instructions](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/360019833020-Download-and-install-Arduino-IDE)
- Once Arduino IDE is installed, you will need the Teensyduino support package for Arduino IDE. Instructions: [Teensyduino install instructions](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_download.html)
- You will also need to add the MIDI library into Arduino IDE. Instructions: [MIDI library instrall instructions](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_MIDI.html)
- The firmware should then be able to compile in Arduino IDE and upload to the Teensy by clicking the upload button. Make sure the Teensy is selected by going to Tools/Ports/ and select the correct serial port the Teensy is plugged into.
